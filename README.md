# HiCu-ICD-codes

The Original setup was a bit old and some dependencies were out of date however it could work but i made edits to my local machine to make it easier for update dependencies the old ones 

Older dependendies in the original HICu Install the following packages to run the code in this repository:

    gensim==4.1.2
    nltk==3.5
    numpy==1.18.1
    pandas==1.0.0
    scikit_learn==1.1.1
    scipy==1.4.1
    torch==1.7.1
    tqdm==4.62.3
    transformers==4.5.1

pip install -r requirements.txt

I used these to overcome issues with dependencies being out of date (Newer updated dependencies if older doesnt work) 

gensim==4.1.2
nltk==3.5
numpy==1.24.4      # originally specified as 1.18.1, but 1.24.4 is compatible with gensim and works fine
pandas==1.0.0
scikit_learn==1.1.1
scipy==1.10.1       # installed with gensim
torch==1.7.1
tqdm==4.62.3
transformers==4.5.1
Note: numpy==1.18.1 was initially requested but replaced by 1.24.4 automatically during gensim installation. This is OK unless you see runtime errors â€” if needed, you can lock it back to 1.18.1.

Step1: Create and activate a virtual environment 

python -m venv hicu-env
hicu-env\Scripts\activate

Step 2: 
cd into the HiCu-ICD-main

Step 3: Install dependencies 

pip install -r requirements.txt

OR 

Can do them manually (optional) 

pip install numpy==1.24.4
pip install gensim==4.1.2
pip install nltk==3.5
pip install pandas==1.0.0
pip install scikit_learn==1.1.1
pip install scipy==1.10.1
pip install torch==1.7.1
pip install tqdm==4.62.3
pip install transformers==4.5.1
